# Explosive-synchonisation-in-Complex-systems

This project originated from my coursework and delves into explosive synchronization within complex networks employing Kuramoto oscillators.

The investigation encompasses (1) Scale-free network, (2) Erdös-Rényi network, (2) Fully connected network and (4) Ring Network. Moreover, we explore the effect of network topology on explosive synchronization.

For further insights, please refer to my project report. (Note: The report was composed during my 3rd year; kindly disregard any discrepancies or mistakes.)
