# Explosive-synchonisation-in-Complex-systems

This project originated from my coursework and delves into explosive synchronization within complex networks employing Kuramoto oscillators.

The investigation encompasses (1) Scale-free networks, (2) Erdös-Rényi networks, and (3) Ring Networks. Moreover, we explore the impact of network topology on explosive synchronization.

For further insights, please refer to my project report. (Note: The report was composed during my 3rd year; kindly disregard any discrepancies or mistakes.)
